				<p>In Serpentine you control a multi-segmented snake in a maze. Your goal is to survive and earn as many points as possible. There are two teams of three snakes each. You, the blue snakes, compete against the orange snakes. Orange snakes become green when your snakes are longer and your snakes can eat green snakes. Called highly addicting by the September 1982 issue of Softline, Serpentine was considered an improvement over Brøderbund’s (the publisher’s) last game.</p>

					<span class="sectionTitle"><i>Impact</i></span><br>The September 1982 issue of Softline stated that Serpentine, while not quite as good graphically as Choplifter (the previous game from Brøderbund), it was twice the game – no mean feat. Serpentine was among the rated games in Computer Gaming World’s 1983 game ratings for games from 1982 - 1983. It had a below average user rating of 5.70.
					<span class="sectionTitle"><br><br><i>Production History</i> </span><br>Serpentine was created by David Snider in 1982. It was published by Brøderbund Software. Brøderbund, headed by Doug Carlston - who was one a member of the “brotherhood” of game makers in the early 1980s - was purchased by The Learning Company in 1998. However, the brand can still be seen on some original Brøderbund products.
