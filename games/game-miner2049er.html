					<span class="sectionTitle"><i>Impact</i></span><br>Softline took a bit of a different approach in its March 1983 of Miner 20-49er, stating, “if you’re reading this review hoping for us to say the game is outstanding, the best of its kind, or a sure bet, you’re out of luck. You already knew it was a great game”. Miner 20-49er ranked number 3 on Softalk’s March 1983 top thirty.
					<span class="sectionTitle"><br><br><i>Production History</i> </span><br>Miner 20-49er was created in 1982. It was created by Mike Livesay for the Apple II. Miner 20-49er was published by Micro Fun, which stopped making games after 1984 - a potential victim of the “Shakeout”. During the Shakeout in the mid-1980s, games failed because of the failure of companies that made the platforms for the games. Microcomputers and consoles like the Commodore VIC and Atari stopped being made and game makers were left with unsellable games and losses that could not be recouped from the manufacturing of games created for the defunct consoles.
