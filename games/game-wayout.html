					<span class="sectionTitle"><i>Impact</i></span><br>Wayout features “truly three-dimensional mazes” (Softline March 1983). This type of game technology was so new that Softline warns that the perspective is not recommended for vertigo sufferers and for those watching someone else play. Wayout was mentioned in the Softline March 1983 issue’s reader poll for receiving a first-place vote by at least one Softline reader. Wayout was among rated games in Computer Gaming World’s 1983 game ratings for games from 1982 - 1983. It had a below average user rating of 6.02.
					<span class="sectionTitle"><br><br><i>Production History</i> </span><br>Wayout was created in 1982. It was created by Paul Edelstein. Wayout was published by Sirius Software, a victim of the “Shakeout”. During the Shakeout in the mid-1980s, games failed because of the failure of companies that made the platforms for the games. Microcomputers and consoles like the Commodore VIC and Atari stopped being made and game makers were left with unsellable games and losses that could not be recouped from the manufacturing of games created for the defunct consoles.
