				<p>In Sherwood Forest, you are Robin Hood and your goal is to marry Maid Marion. However, you’ve been hit on the head by the Sheriff of Nottingham, temporarily losing your memory. You may safely assume that the sheriff is not your friend and the Merry Men are ok, but other than that, you are on your own!</p>

					<span class="sectionTitle"><i>Impact</i></span><br>The graphics in Sherwood Forest are “wonderful” according the Softline in January 1983. In addition to the excellent graphics, Sherwood Forest has quick screen redrawing and save functions with no “fuzzy areas or objects”.
					<span class="sectionTitle"><br><br><i>Production History</i> </span><br>Sherwood Forest was created in 1982. It was created by Dave Holle and Dale Johnson. Sherwood Forest was published by Phoenix Software, a potential victim of the “Shakeout”. During the Shakeout in the mid-1980s, games failed because of the failure of companies that made the platforms for the games. Microcomputers and consoles like the Commodore VIC and Atari stopped being made and game makers were left with unsellable games and losses that could not be recouped from the manufacturing of games created for the defunct consoles. Additionally, larger companies started to enter the industry and the advertising rates were going up.
