				<p>Ali Baba is an adventure game that “displays a sense of creative humor that lifts it above routine adventure games” (Softline July 1982). Ali Baba is played in a series of chambers and secret passageways. The player plays as Ali Baba collecting/buying armor and gold, and rescuing captives and a princess. Ali Baba, along with rescued captives, is controlled in a turn-based fashion by one player or in a co-operative mode.</p>

                    <span class="sectionTitle"><i>Impact</i></span><br>Softline stated that while the graphics of Ali Baba were simplistic, the “major joy” of the game is the sense of discovery, and its secrets. Quality Software (Ali Baba’s publisher) made its last game in 1983 and can be perhaps considered a victim of the “Shakeout”. During the Shakeout in the mid-1980s, games failed because of the failure of companies that made the platforms for the games. Microcomputers and consoles like the Commodore VIC and Atari stopped being made and game makers were left with unsellable games and losses that could not be recouped from the manufacturing of games created for the defunct consoles.<br><br>
					<span class="sectionTitle"><i>Production History</i> </span><br>Ali Baba was created for the Apple II in 1982. It was created by Stuart Smith. Ali Baba was published by Quality Software.
