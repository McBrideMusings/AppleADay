				<p>Dnieper River Line, a cross between a board game and a computer game, is a strategy game about a standoff between German and Russian forces in the Southern Ukraine in late 1943. As the Germans, players must protect six possible objective squares. There are four levels of play: two different scenario beginnings, a meeting engagement, and a strategic offensive. A campaign takes between eight and twelve turns. The Russians win if they have control of two of three secret objectives.</p>

					<span class="sectionTitle"><i>Impact</i></span><br>Softline’s March 1983 issue describes the game as excellent. It is a step up for Avalon Hill (the publisher), which had great board war games, but was “disappointing in its early computer fare”. Dnieper River Line was among rated games in Computer Gaming World’s 1983 game ratings for games from 1982 - 1983. It had an above average user rating of 6.71.
					<span class="sectionTitle"><br><br><i>Production History</i> </span><br>Dnieper River Line was created in 1982. It was created by Bruce A. Ketchledge. Dnieper River Line was published by Microcomputer Games, a division of Avalon Hill. The Avalon Hill Game Company produced numerous strategy and role-playing games of many types. In the early to mid-1980s, Avalon Hill formed their Microcomputer Games division, which produced primarily strategy games for multiple computer platforms. Hasbro bought Avalon Hill in 1998.
