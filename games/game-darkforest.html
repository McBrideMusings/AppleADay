            <span class="sectionTitle"><i>Game Play</i></span><br>Dark Forest is described as a “take-over-the-world war game” by Softline in January 1982. Players choose a character and a castle (territory) to begin with, and then make attempts to gain territory and consequently more troops for territory gains. There are Gruds - non-player characters (NPCs) - who will attempt to fight any territory with fewer troops adjacent to one of their own territories and a serpent who eats troops indiscriminately.<br><br>

            <span class="sectionTitle"><i>Impact</i></span><br>Dark Forest was a strategy game and described as not being very “deep”, however being an ideal family game for up to six players (Softline January 1982). Dark Forest was rated a top 5 strategy game by the February 1982 Softalk issue.<br><br>
            <span class="sectionTitle"><i>Production History</i> </span><br>Dark Forest was released in 1981. It was created by Jerry Jewell and Tom Mornini. Dark Forest was published by Sirius Software, also known for Space Eggs, and a victim of the “Shakeout”. During the Shakeout in the mid-1980s, games failed because of the failure of companies that made the platforms for the games. Microcomputers and consoles like the Commodore VIC and Atari stopped being made and game makers were left with unsellable games and losses that could not be recouped from the manufacturing of games created for the defunct consoles.
